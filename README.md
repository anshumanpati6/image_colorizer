## A Simple Image Colorizer that is a PITA to train

To run the model with pretrained weights - 
1. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/anshumanpati6/image_colorizer.git`
2. To install prerequisite libraries `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the pretrained weights [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/162UIt7OVqLKQEdcsP2xGzV2rnFCRBkwn?usp=sharing)
4. Run the web app on streamlit - `streamlit run new_app.py`
5. In case the custom theme is not applied on Streamlit, open settings on hamburger menu and select theme -> custom theme.
6. Suffer.
